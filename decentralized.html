                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p> The extant system of solid waste management is not only ecologically and environmentally unsustainable, but also uneconomical and highly inefficient. While the rest of the world is aspiring to go the Zero-waste way, the Corporation of Chennai is vehemently rooting for landfills and incineration, the evil twin of centralised waste management that is currently in practice. Besides being unsustainable on several counts, the practice in its current form breeds corruption, lack of transparency and accountability by relying on privatisation of its services. The decentralised model that is being advocated as an alternative to the centralised waste management seeks to address the issues that makes the system highly inappropriate to be pursued in its current form. This alternate zero-waste model precisely represents a holistic vision that every community must aspire to move towards in order to restore the balance in ecology, environment and eradicate corruption in public services.

                <p> Zero-waste represents a system in which the households are encouraged to manage their waste by segregating at source, even in the absence of a political will. The wet waste which forms the bulk of the domestic waste should be managed on the premises as far as possible. The recyclables can be accumulated and sold to authorised waste pickers or recyclers so as to fuel the informal waste economy. The residual waste can then be managed by authorised waste collectors or agencies until the system becomes zero-waste and sustains itself. By segregating wet waste and managing the other dry waste locally, sizeable load is taken off the solid waste that goes to the landfills. </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/IMG_5226.jpg">

                <p> The Solid waste management rules of 2016 classifies any entity that generates 100 Kgs of waste or more, per day, as a Bulk Waste Producer (BWP). Hotels and restaurants naturally form the majority of BWPs in any city. The rules mandate in-situ management of biodegradable wastes for  BWPs while the remaining goes to the informal waste economy or to authorised agents.</p>

                <p>
                 Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and Market associations can be categorized as BWPs for the amount of waste they generate. Just like the other BWPs, they are mandated to manage their wet wastes in-situ, while flushing out the other dry waste through appropriate formal and informal channels.</p>

                <p>
                 An event or gathering of more than 100 persons naturally generates a waste of quantum equal to a BWP. The collection and management mechanism should provide for source segregation and capacity to disintegrate the wet wastes within the premises. The recyclables and residues can be managed by appropriate formal or informal agents when disposed responsibly.</p>

                <p>
                 A bulk of waste from street sweeping is typically the horticulture waste which can be used to service public and private composts on request from citizens. The rest of the waste comprises dust and litter which currently renders this waste unusable. This should be segregated to extract usable organic waste such as dry leaves.
