                <h2>Gentrification in West Oakland</h2>

                <p>We tend to talk about gentrification as one story: newcomers
                displace long-time residents, erasing history and disrupting
                culture in the process. But living through dramatic
                neighborhood change always brings up many stories. Those
                stories--from West Oakland's people and places--are what this
                interactive is all about.</p>

                <p>There's a lot to disagree about, when it comes to
                gentrification. But one thing seems beyond debate. If you're
                new to a place, it's good to know a thing or two about its
                history. So West Oakland's proud past is one of the most
                important stories you'll learn about in West Side
                Stories.</p>

                "images/hotel.png">

                <p>Built in the 1920s, the California Hotel was once a place
                that welcomed African American artists and musicians when they
                were discriminated against elsewhere. In the early 1970s, the construction of the 580 freeway and the "suburbanization" of the neighborhood took a toll on the hotel and it was shut down. Fast forward to 2011:
                the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation and other
                supporters pulled together funds for a major renovation. Now,
                the California Hotel provides 137 units of low-income housing
                and even has a rooftop garden.</p>

                <p>Turf dancing is a form of street dance that is said
                to have originated in Oakland, California. According to locals,
                credit for the term goes to dancer Jeriel Bey, who created it
                as an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor. Dance elements include popping,
                locking, and miming. If you ride through the West Oakland BART
                station, you just might encounter a Turf dancer, making the
                most of the crowded train as a moving stage.</p>

                "images/station.png">

                <p>Built in 1912 and no longer in active use, the 16th Street station was once among the largest transportation centers in Oakland. It housed the West Coast branch of the very first African American Labor Union in America and was the last stop for many African Americans leaving the South. The station is now managed by an affordable housing non-profit with ambitious plans for restoration. In the meantime, it's occasionally used for events like haunted houses and film shoots. The plaza outside the station is home to three urban agriculture projects including a workforce development program for Oakland teens.</p>

                <p>U.S. Olympic sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold
                and bronze medalists in the 200 meter, stood at the medal
                podium during the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City, bowed their
                heads and held a black-gloved hand raised as the American
                National Anthem played during the victory ceremony. This was a
                mural commemorating this historic Olympic event, with images of
                the athletes and the phrase, "It only takes a pair of gloves."
                If you happen to pass by, you'll notice the mural no longer exists. The building had been used as a decontamination station, and once that work was done, the structure was bulldozed, taking the mural with it, according to Oakland Council member Lynette Gibson McElhaney.</p>
