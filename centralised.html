                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                  Chennai has increased its waste generation from 600 to 5200 metric tons per day (tpd) in just over two decades. As per some studies, Chennai is also the highest per capita waste generator among cities in India at 700 gms per person per day. Unfortunately, the city’s waste management infrastructure has been unable to keep up with its rapid growth. The Corporation of Chennai (CoC) is spending more funds than ever on hauling contracts and other short-term solutions, while the city has failed to think about the issue of waste with a view towards long-term sustainability. In this storymap, you will see how waste is generated across the city but hauled by trucks to the city’s landfills in Kodungaiyur and Perungudi.

                <h3>Street Sweeping</h3>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.5 Street sweeping.jpg">

                <p>Waste is collected by conservancy workers engaged by CoC and Ramky, a private firm contracted for SWM in Zone 9, 10 and 13, from streets. Ramky is responsible for door-to-door collection, transportation to the Perungudi landfill, street sweeping and maintenance of dumpsters. However, in 2014 nearly 80% of people surveyed in Ward 173 (Zone 13) said that they did not receive door-to-door-collection services.</p>

                <h3>Dumpsters</h3>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.3 Dumpster.jpg">

                <p>
The CoC places large green dumpsters on streets for people to dispose their waste. This is the primary mode of disposal used by households and small commercial establishments. Many dumpsters can be seen to be overflowing or overturned, and their immediate vicinity strewn with garbage, and also become locations of open urination.

                <h3>Bulk Waste Producers</h3>
                <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.4 BWPs.jpg">

                <p>
Bulk waste producers (BWPs) are generators of waste that exceed an average of 100 kgs per day. They include commercial and non commercial establishments that generate both wet and dry waste. At present, bulk waste producers either dump their waste in CoC bins or have the CoC lorries pick up the large quantities of waste directly from the premise. Despite the SWM Rules 2016 that mandate BWPs take responsibility for their own waste, we see them continue to brazenly evade their responsibility.                 </p>

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.6 Transfer station.jpg">
                <p>
Tricycles or small vehicles traverse through narrow streets, collecting garbage from door- to- door. The garbage is then emptied into large dumpsters stationed on every street corner. Each ward in the city is allotted 5 to 12 tricycles depending on the area of the ward.

                <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.6 Transfer station.jpg">
                <p>
                  Transfer stations act as  common points of garbage collection for every zone. There are a total of 8 transfer stations in the city of Chennai. To optimise transport, large trucks/ compactors haul the waste from street dumpsters all the way up to the city’s dump yard.

              <h3>Kodungaiyur waste yard</h3>
              <img class="feature-img" src="images/1.8 Kodungaiyur waste yard.jpg">
              <p>Chennai city generates close to 3,200 tonnes of garbage on a daily basis. The Kodungaiyur waste yard is a residential neighbourhood in the northernmost part of the city of Chennai. Garbage from zones one to eight are carried by tipper trucks to the Kodungaiyur waste yard, which is a stretch of land of 270 acres. The garbage for the remaining seven zones are heaved to the Perungudi landfill in South Chennai.

              <p>The Adyar river, once a source of pristine water, has been reduced to a sewer. Indiscriminate dumping of garbage and debris, sewage and industrial effluents in the Adyar River have caused it to become heavily polluted, killing aquatic life.
